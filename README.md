## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

## Objective

The objective of this challenge was to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset. 

## Result

The app.js file will allow users to filter the table data by date only using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. Additionally, you can visit this site to check out the end result https://katrinan029.github.io/javascript-challenge/.
